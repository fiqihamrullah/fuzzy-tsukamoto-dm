# Solving Diabetes Militus Case with Fuzzy Tsukamoto

Fuzzy Tsukamoto can handle imprecise or uncertain data effectively, making it suitable for medical decision-making where precise measurements may be lacking. In this case, Diabetes Militus (DM) will be the main case to be solved using fuzzy inference with Tsukamoto Method. This application provides dyanmic linguistic variables and sets and also dynamic rule bases.
